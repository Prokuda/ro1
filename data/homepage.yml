  content : "Newitz travels to all four sites and investigates the cutting-edge research in archaeology, 
  revealing the mix of environmental changes and political turmoil that doomed these ancient settlements. 
  Tracing the early development of urban planning, Newitz also introduces us to the often anonymous workers — 
  slaves, women, immigrants, and manual laborers — who built these cities and created monuments that lasted millennia."
